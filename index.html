<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to Head in the Clouds. This site was designed and developed as part of a class project that would allow a user to learn about clouds, while also practicing what they've learned via a flash card type system. The site itself is very lightweight. No external libraries are being called and the CSS has been minfied as best as possible. It utilizes a responsive design. 
</p>
<p>The topic itself, clouds, was chosen as almost a play on words. Often times when people think of clouds these days, in relation to computers, they think of cloud computing.</p>	
<p>If you enjoy learning about clouds, more information can be found at : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_nKH5QyUa8" title="Youtube Video">Clouds and Climate Science</a> | <a href="https://scijinks.gov/" title="Informational Science site for Kids by NOAA">NOAA SciJinks</a> </p>

<h3>Some Information about clouds</h3>	
<p>A cloud is like the steam in your bathroom, or the fog you might sometimes walk through – it is a parcel of air with a whole lot of very tiny droplets of water in it, just suspended in the air. It is mainly air, because the droplets are really tiny and far apart, usually ten of them side by side would only be as wide as one human hair. Even although there might be anything from 50 to 250 droplets in a cubic centimetre (that’s a space about the size of the end of your finger) the distance from one droplet to the next could be 1000 times more than the width of a droplet. The droplets are so small they do not fall, unless by chance two or more get thrown together in the cloud and combine to form a heavier drop. If they do this, and start to fall, they are quite likely to sweep up other droplets underneath them and grow bigger and bigger and fall faster and faster, until they can fall out of the cloud as a raindrop.</p>
<p>A cloud is formed when warm, moist air rises and cools. Why? The air always contains some moisture (think about where the water goes to when the washing on the line dries.) When the sun comes out and it is warm, puddles, rivers, the sea all evaporate, and moisture from them goes into the air. Cool air can hold less moisture than warm air. So if warm air with lots of moisture in it cools down, the moisture forms little cloud droplets in the air. Air cools as it rises. This is because higher in the atmosphere the pressure is less so the air expands and air cools as it expands. So if moist air rises in the atmosphere, some of the water vapour in rising air condenses forming the tiny cloud droplets.</p>	
<p>The shape and appearance of the cloud depends on the shape of the rising parcel of air. If it is a ‘puff’ of rising air the cloud might look like a small white puffy cloud, called a ‘fair-weather cumulus cloud.’ If it is a puff that then sucks more and more air up after it into the cloud (check the links below to see how and why this might happen), the cloud grows much larger and may turn into a towering thunderstorm. If the air rises because it is being pushed up over a range of hills the cloud may look long and smooth, called a lenticular cloud. These often form over the Tararua ranges, between Wellington and the Wairarapa, and also over Canterbury where it is called the nor-west arch cloud.</p>	
<p>If the cloud is high enough, and cold enough, some of the water droplets might freeze and then the cloud is made of ice crystals as well as (or instead of) water droplets.</p>
